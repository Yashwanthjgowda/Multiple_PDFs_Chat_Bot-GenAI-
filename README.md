# Multiple_PDFs_Chat_Bot-GenAI-
The Multiple PDFs Chat Bot (GenAI) is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and interact with them conversationally. Instead of manually searching through PDFs, users can simply ask questions, and the chatbot intelligently retrieves relevant information from the documents.

# ✨ Key Features
✅ Multiple PDF Support – Upload and process several PDFs simultaneously.

✅ Generative AI-based Q&A – Uses LangChain and LLMs (like Gemini or OpenAI GPT) to answer questions contextually.

✅ Efficient Text Processing – Extracts text using PyPDF2 / pdfplumber and splits it using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for better understanding.

✅ Vector Search – Creates embeddings with Google Generative AI embeddings / OpenAI embeddings and stores them in FAISS for semantic search.

✅ Interactive Chat Interface – Built using Streamlit, enabling real-time conversational interaction.

✅ Context-Aware Responses – Provides precise answers by retrieving relevant chunks of data from uploaded PDFs.
